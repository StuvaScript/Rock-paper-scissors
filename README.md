# Rock-paper-scissors

I'm trying to create a rock paper scissors game. Here is my pseudocode:

I'm going to generate a random number between 1 and 3. I'm going to turn those values into either rock, paper, or scissors. That'll be the computer's choice.

I'm going to put in an input field with prompt() so that I can choose rock, paper, or scissors. 

I need to define that one choice is greater than the other choice.

I need to have a string that tells who the winner is.

I need to build a function that keeps a running tally of whoever wins' score. Then compare the two numbers at the end of 5 rounds to determine the overall champion.
