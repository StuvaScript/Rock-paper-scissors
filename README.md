I used JavaScript to create a simple rock-paper-scissors game where the user selects a hand gesture and competes against the computer. I programmed the game logic using conditional statements and implemented a scoring system to track the player's wins and losses. Through this project, I'm demonstrating my ability to use JavaScript to build interactive and engaging web applications!
